ple want me to write a README file for the plugin, so I guess I will

Installation/Configuration:
1. Copy suckchat.jar into your plugins folder
2. Run your server, this will automatically write default values out for your configuration
3. Stop the server and edit the configuration files to your heart's contempt
4. Start the server again

You are now operational.

If you, for any reason, need support for this plugin, join us on #cosban at irc.rozznet.net

Also there is the whole license thing. It basically goes like this:
1. Use the software at your own risk, any harm that it does is your fault.
2. Copy this software as you want, you just have to give me credit for it.
